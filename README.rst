Demo
----

A screenshot is worth a thousand words, but a Demo is worth a thousand
screenshots.
You can now play with ``Burp-UI`` at `demo.ziirish.me <https://demo.ziirish.me>`_

Credentials:

- *admin / admin* to play with ``Burp-UI`` as an administrator
- *demo / demo* to play with ``Burp-UI`` as a regular user


What's that?
------------

Let me introduce you ``Burp-UI``. It is a web-based UI to manage your
burp-servers.
You can view different reports about burp-servers, burp-clients, backups, etc.
``Burp-UI`` allows you to perform *online* restorations and to edit/manage
your burp-server's configuration files.
